# 📈 Key Findings
## 1. 📉 Revenue Decline in 2016–2017
2016: Revenue dropped by -10.52%

2017: Sharp decline of -72.09%

Root Cause: Web development content became outdated due to the fast-paced tech industry. Lack of timely updates led to a loss of interest and relevance.


## 2. 🌐 Web Development Courses Dominate
Generated 71.18% of total revenue.

However, engagement plummeted post-2015, needing realignment with current tech trends.


## 3. ⏳ Subscriber Preference for Shorter Courses
88.10% of subscribers favor courses under 15 hours.

Suggestion: Split longer courses into bite-sized modules or create new shorter ones.


## 4. 💰 Pricing Sweet Spots
High engagement in two ranges:

$0–$25 (budget-friendly)

$190–$200 (premium/elite)

Over 51.09% of total revenue comes from only 422 premium courses, while 2,330+ budget courses generate just 6.33% of revenue.


## 5. 🎓 Expert-Level Courses Underrepresented
Only 0.62% of revenue comes from expert-level courses.

However, these show the highest revenue per subscriber.

Strategy: Better advertising and highlighting expertise can attract more enrollments.





# 💡 Recommendations
📚 Update Content Regularly: Especially for high-revenue subjects like web development.

🧩 Introduce Mid-Range Courses: Bridge the gap between low-cost and premium options.
